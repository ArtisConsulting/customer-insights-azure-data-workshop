The sample datasets in this folder are used during this workshop. The datasets are a simple fictitious customer dataset around telecom churn (cancelling service).

See [Lab 1](../lab01.md) and [Lab 3](../lab03.md) and [Lab 6](../lab06.md) for step-by-step instructions to use these datasets in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Azure Synapse Analytics.
